# PhonePe Transactions Analysis using Python

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze PhonePe transaction data to
understand digital payment trends across India at both state and district
levels, including transaction behavior, device usage, and demographic
influence.

## Dataset Description
The raw dataset is an Excel file containing **5 sheets**:

1. **State-wise Transactions and Users**  
   - Total transaction amount
   - Transaction count
   - Registered users

2. **State-wise Transactions by Transaction Type**  
   - Peer-to-peer
   - Merchant payments
   - Recharge & bill payments
   - Financial services

3. **State-wise Device Data**  
   - Device brand
   - User distribution by device type

4. **District-wise Transactions, Users and App Opens**  
   - Transaction amount and count
   - Registered users
   - App opens

5. **District Demographics**  
   - Population
   - Demographic distribution

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Performed
- Loaded and processed multi-sheet Excel data using Pandas
- Cleaned and transformed state-wise and district-wise datasets
- Analyzed transaction trends at state and district levels
- Performed transaction type-wise analysis to understand usage behavior
- Analyzed device-wise user distribution across states
- Studied district-level transaction activity in relation to demographics
- Visualized insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Key Insights
- Digital transactions show consistent growth across most states
- Merchant payments contribute significantly to overall transaction value
- Smartphone brand usage varies significantly by region
- Districts with higher population density show increased transaction activity
- App opens closely correlate with transaction frequency

## Visualizations
- State-wise transaction trends over time
- Transaction type distribution across states
- Device usage comparison
- District-level transaction and user analysis

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis using Python, including
data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to derive
business insights from real-world digital payments data.
